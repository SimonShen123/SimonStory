	Bailey lives in Madison, Wisconsin. Without enough sunlight during the day, the cold Wisconsin winter bores him to death. He decided to spice up the unexciting life of his by robbing a PizzaHut. There was just something about PizzaHut that he didn't like. Maybe it was the overpriced pizza or the inconsistent amount of pepperoni they added to their pizza. Nonetheless, Bailey decided to device a quick plan as to how he would rob this PizzaHut. Bailey went into the PizzaHut on a cold Thursday afternoon, and demanded the cash from the cashier. The cashier proceeded to look at Bailey in shock and threw a pizza at him, hitting him square in the face.
